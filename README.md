## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught and university-trained software developer with 1.5+ years of experience in full stack web development and applied data projects. I’ve worked on projects in the public sector and academic research, delivering solutions for process automation, robotics control, and municipal systems.

I enjoy learning and working on systems that make a real-world impact. Currently, I’m building up my cloud knowledge and learning about **AWS** and **DevOps pipelines**.
